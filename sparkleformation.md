## What is Sparkleformation?

Sparkleformation is a Ruby based DSL specifically focused around describing and, combined with chef & knife, can be used to deploy infrastructre resources in AWS and other cloud environments.

## Installation:

**Prerequisites**:

* [Ruby 1.9.3](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) or newer. The current version is [2.1.5](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).
* [knife](https://docs.getchef.com/knife.html) 

Installation is a little tricky since the product is still in a beta state, albeit things may be changing real soon with new knife releases. It's solid, there are just a few extra configuration and steps to tweak things before getting up and running smoothly. For a quick walk-through of the installation steps check out the docs [Getting Started](https://github.com/sparkleformation/sparkle_formation/tree/master/docs#getting-started) section.
