The complexities and frustrations are often found there that often drive DevOps efforts to slim down systems and clean up deploy paths for dev or for pre-built application systems that would be hosted in enterprise systems.
* The other thing is a clear ability to present well, describe things simply, and and put together information in a way that can be presented from in a simple way.
