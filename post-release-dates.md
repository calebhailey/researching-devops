Post Release Dates:

* I'd suggest the first three in early December when traveling hasn't started. Probably December on the 1st, 4th and then 8th for the intro articles and then a summary around the 11th or 15th with a bunch of cross-posting and maybe even a related article to point back at it to incur discussion and backlinks.
* Another option is to gather additional material and get a regular posting cadence started (either in December if possible) or in early January. I believe Luc Perkins and Edward Irby are two other candidates that would be good to have some guest posts from. They're not seriously experienced w/ devops specifically, but that might be the perfect key starter articles to start publishing and ramping up a community around. On the flip - it might be better to start building articles from a more hard core perspective. It's a tough strategy call.

Questions:

* Where to release (my blog, cross post, HWO blog)?
* What dates (the above are just suggestions)?
* Are there follow on topics?
* Is there a plan to push the blog entries from a marketing perspective, and how could I help with that?
